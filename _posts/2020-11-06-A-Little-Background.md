I had to do something. I graduated college in 2016. It wasn't until this moment I began to ask the questions I had not considered for before. Who am I? What should I be doing? What do I value? What do I believe? 

You can only be independent of God while you've got youth and prosperity - Aldous Huxley 

I do not interpret God here to a specific ideology (Christian, Muslim, Hindu etc) but in the more general "what does this all mean" way. What people my age tend to refer to as spirituality. This dilemma has been felt for eons by humans and is responded to in a possibly infinite amount of ways. Before I could get into all those big questions, though, it felt I had to learn more about me. Otherwise it felt like trying to write a compose a song without being able to read music. This particular blog post will not be about self-exploration. This process did lead me to (re)discover how much I enjoy writing and thus the Stained Shirt(1) was born. 

The vision of this website will be formed on the fly. For now it will serve as a place to write down all the things that currently take up space in my brain. That includes (but is not limited to)

NBA 
Books I've read
Pop culture (primarily movies)
Politics 
Fantasy Football
Hip hop
I am not an expert in anything. There will not be a lot of answers on this site. Quite the opposite. The only thing I feel confident in is my ignorance. 

Welcome to the Stained Shirt. 

(1)Stained Shirt came from an inside joke between my girlfriend and I. She believes there is not a single shirt I own that is not stained (I'm sure there are a few.) She recommended the name and it felt like a good blog post name.
